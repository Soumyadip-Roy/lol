                            <p class="para_head">Director's Message</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Army Institute of Technology is a Premier Engineering College in the region. Having received the “Best Professional College (Urban)” Trophy in Pune University in Feb 2017, it has been rated amongst top three colleges in Pune region by all the ranking agencies.

                                AIT has had a large number of achievements. Most of them attributed to the wonderful students, full of energy and competitive spirit. One of the most notable achievers was Capt Shipra Muzumdar of 2001 batch, who climbed Mt Everest on 03 Jul 2005 as a member of Indian Army first all Women expedition.
                                
                                AIT students are always in the news for their technical achievements, and innovations. M Rajesh, 2002 batch Computer Engineer was felicitated by Bill Gates for winning the Microsoft sponsored Imagica Cup. Lavpreet Sharma, 2014 batch Mechanical Engineer, made AIT proud by winning the Sword of Honour in the Airforce Academy.
                                
                                AIT students have been winning many hackathons and innovation competitions at National and International level. AIT students have won the prestigious KPIT, Sparkle innovation championship, two years in succession in 2019 and 2020. Both innovations were in the field of out of box devices to generate clean renewable energy. In 2020 AIT teams won top three prizes in NEC Hackathon. Sekhar Kumar Singh won part of winning Multi-National team of UNESCO India- Africa Hackathon. AIT team also came runner up in Sainya Ranakshetram 2.0 – Capture the Flag in Dec 2022. AIT created history when its three teams swept the top three prizes in NEC hackathon at IIT Delhi, which had a theme of "Use of Technology in education for students in rural areas". Though predominantly UG college, AIT students have been at the forefront of entrepreneurship and startups. AIT has over 50 alumni who are running successful startups.
                                
                                AIT students have enjoyed excellent placements over the years. The 2022-23 batch has achieved 96% placements with an average salary of Rs. 14.2 lakh. A good number of AIT students of second and third year have enrolled for internships with reputed companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Deutsche Bank, Dream Plug and some Indian start-ups. Many of them are drawing monthly stipend of over Rs. One lakh. Internships with such reputed organisations provide a great launch pad for amazing careers. One such student Mr Abhishek Kumar of TE(IT) has been selected for an internship with Amazon London, at a monthly stipend of equivalent to Rs. Four lakh approx, another Shristy Thakur SE (E&TC) student has proceeded for an internship in Jun 23 at Barclays Bank in UK for monthly stipend of equivalent to Rs. 3 lakhs.
                                
                                With the approval of the AIT Growth plan by HQ AWES, the intake of AIT is set to double in next 3-4 years. We are already increasing the intake in IT stream by 60 in AY 2023-24. We will be introducing a UG course in BE (Robotics and Automation). AIT is also looking at introducing new PG programs, establishing Centres of Excellence and Research Centres. The ME course in Data Science has already been launched this year. Apart from regular degree courses, AIT is also starting short term diploma/certification courses in collaboration with reputed training institutes in niche technology fields such as Embedded Systems, VLSI, Data Science etc, to meet the fast growing demands of industry.
                                
                                All these student achievements cannot be accomplished without commitment, guidance and support of the committed faculty of AIT. The faculty too is going all out to enhance their knowledge, reputation and improve the research footprint of the college.
                                
                                AIT prides itself in having an excellent academic extracurricular and sports infrastructure. This ensures all round development of students and total quality engineers passing out from AIT.
