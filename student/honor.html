                <p>An Honour Code or Honour System is a set of rules or ethical principles governing a community based on ideals that define what constitutes honourable behavior within that community. The use of an honour code depends on the notion that people (at least within the community) can be trusted to act honourably. Those who are in violation of the Honour Code can be subject to various sanctions/ restrictions/punishments.</p>

                <p class="para_head">Honour Code of AIT</p>
                <p>An AIT student will not lie, cheat or steal; We will neither indulge in ragging, smoking, consuming alcohol or use psychotropic substances (drugs), nor tolerate those who do.</p>

                <p class="para_head">Application of the Honour Code</p>
                <p>Every student of AIT is expected to behave as a gentle man / gentle woman/lady. Honour Code is a declaration by the entire college community that the honourable course is the most just; and therefore the best. This code is concerned with an academic as well as a social component, demanding equal respect among all students. Students are responsible for understanding the Honour Code and its implementation in the Army Institute of Technology. If a student believes that a faculty member or administrator is not doing what the Honour Code calls for, the student should contact his/her staff counselor or a staff member of the Honour Board or make a report to the Principal/JD/Dir.                </p>
                <br><p>Each AIT student is responsible for knowing and adhering to the Code. Each student is expected to own up any Honour Code violation caused by him/her. Each AIT student is honour bound to report immediately all violations of the Honour Code of which the student has first-hand knowledge; failure to do so is itself a violation of the Honour Code.</p>
                <br><p>Students of AIT are expected to uphold academic excellence and high community standards by practicing responsible citizenship that protects the core principles of the College, more so as AIT is a residential college. With the privilege of having a diverse student body, students should be able to interact and learn from each other in ways that uphold community respect and personal freedom. The Honour Code sets the tone for campus life and acts as a philosophy to live by through demonstrating a commitment to personal participation in improving the quality of life in our community</p>
